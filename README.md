# MERN Authentication Boilerplate

## Introduction

MERN Authentication Boilerplate, a fully functional authentication setup built using the MERN stack. This project is designed to serve as a starting point for developers who want to integrate authentication seamlessly into their MERN applications.

## Tech Stack

This boilerplate leverages the following technologies:

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user credentials securely.

- Express.js: Backend framework to handle authentication routes and API requests.

- React.js: Frontend library for creating a responsive and interactive UI.

- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

## Authentication Mechanism

This project implements authentication using Passport.js with JWT (JSON Web Token), ensuring secure user authentication. The backend is responsible for verifying user credentials and issuing JWTs, while the frontend uses Axios to make API requests for authentication-related operations.

## Features

- User Registration and Login

- Password Hashing using bcrypt

- JWT-based Authentication

- Protected Routes Implementation

- Token Expiry Handling

- Fully Functional Frontend Integration

## How to Use

This repository serves as a boilerplate for authentication in [MERN] applications. Developers can clone the project, modify configurations, and integrate additional features as needed.

Stay tuned for further improvements and enhancements.
